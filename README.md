# About AlgoGraph

This is a project meant to demonstrate the ability to utilize D3 within React.  A bar graph generated by D3 displays a randomized data set that can be sorted step by step.
Custom hooks (useD3 and useInterval) were utilized to inject D3 code and allow for adjustable intervals for sorting.  

## Features

### Adjustable Data Set

The range of possible numbers and quantity of numbers generated for the data set can be adjusted to allow for a variety of different sets of numbers

### Theming

Different theme options can be chosen to dynamically change the color schematic of the page

### Sorting Options

Users can choose between Insertion, Selection, and Bubble sorts to sort the data as well as the ordering of the sort (ascending or descending)

### Dynamic Sorting

Sorting steps are done in real-time at intervals.  The duration of intervals can be adjusted before and during the sorting process.

## Dependencies

-D3, Material-UI
